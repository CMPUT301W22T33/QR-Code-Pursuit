summary:
- tie halfway point issues so they function together
- assigning remaining issues

(all) using "navigation components"? (android jetpack)
- is it worth it? 
    - maybe for Login, Account, Scan
    - maybe not for Map, Leaderboard
- idea: seperate nav graphs for login/home/map/leaderboard/account

(Kevin) GameQR stuff
- (Kevin) GameQRCode model fleshout; remove actual QR raw data
    -> QR codes without a photo: use placeholder image
- (Kevin) how to store images in firestore
    - as bitstream..? will explore different ways
    -> or, use Firebase Storage: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/3/project/qrcodepursuit/storage/qrcodepursuit.appspot.com
- (Kevin) gameQRinfoFragment fragment for when leaderboard/map QR codes are clicked
    - Comments: GameQRcode doesn't own comments
    -> just store link sin DB: comments ref[] as a field of QR documents
    -> pull them on the fly in GameQRinfoFragment

(Jeff) Accounts, Login stuff
- how to assign QRs to players; what are accounts even
    - "use custom objects for firestore documents" : https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/manage-data/add-data#custom_objects
    -> (Jeff) just make account class fit into firestore
    -> (Kevin) on that note, make GameQRcode class the same way to fit into firestore
- (Jeff) account document identifier as UID (on firestore/Accounts)

(Bjorn) MAP
    - depends on features: GPS, GameQRinfoFragment
    
- WAIFU holding a gigantic qr (but seriously, placeholder img for qr without photo)

next meeting tuesday (Mar 29)
