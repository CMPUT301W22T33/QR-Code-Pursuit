- tie halfway point issues so they function together
- assigning remaining issues
- gameqrclass fleshout; remove actual QR raw data
	- how to display QR codes without a photo; just put question mark
- how to assign QRs to players; what are accounts even
	- just make a custom account class that fits into firestore
	- on that note, make QR code the same way to fit into firestore
- account document identifier as UID (on firestore)
- MAP
- navigation thru android navigation component
	- how leaderboard navigation would work
	- apply this to scan as well
- how to store images in firestore
- gameQRinfo fragment for when leaderboard/map QR codes are clicked
- should gameQRcode own comments, or should it just be a DB thing
- comments handled on the fly in gameQRinfo

- WAIFU holding a gigantic qr (but seriously, placeholder img for qr without photo)

next meeting tuesday
